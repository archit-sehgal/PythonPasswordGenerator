<h1>PythonPasswordGenerator</h1>
The provided code generates a random password based on the user's specifications for the number of numbers, letters, and symbols in the password. Here's a step-by-step description of the code:

Import the random module: This module is used to generate random values.

Define lists x, y, and z: These lists store possible characters for numbers, letters, and symbols that can be used in the password.

Get user input for the number of numbers, letters, and symbols:

num: Number of numbers in the password.
lett: Number of letters in the password.
symb: Number of symbols in the password.
Initialize an empty list pasw to store the password elements.

Generate password components:

A loop iterates num times to add random numbers from list x to the pasw list.
Another loop iterates lett times to add random letters from list y to the pasw list.
A third loop iterates symb times to add random symbols from list z to the pasw list.
Shuffle the password elements: The random.shuffle() function shuffles the elements within the pasw list to mix up the order.

Convert the password list to a string:

The ''.join(pasw) operation concatenates all elements in the pasw list into a single string.
The resulting string is assigned to the password variable.
Print the generated password: The generated password string stored in the password variable is printed as the output of the script.

In summary, this code generates a random password by combining random numbers, letters, and symbols as specified by the user. The elements are shuffled to enhance security, and the final password is presented as a single string.
